EED 568ACT is the second field experience in the ACT Pathway and the culminating student teaching experience for Multiple Subject Credential candidates enrolled in ACT. The field experience provides the teacher candidate the opportunity to establish connections among course content theories of teaching and learning and classroom pedagogy. In this course students develop skills in assessing pupils and planning and implementing the elementary curriculum and are provided formative feedback necessary to teach in the full range of domains defined by the California Standards for the Teaching Profession and associated Teacher Performance Expectations. This field experience provides the teacher candidate the opportunity to work toward the goal of assuming the full responsibilities of a certificated teacher. The 8-week (approximately 240 hours) field experience takes place in participating public schools and expands on the first student teaching assignment with the inclusion of planning implementing and evaluating social studies science arts physical education and health education curriculum to the responsibilities of the student teacher.
